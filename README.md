Larian Studios' Osiris VM reverse-engineering project
=====================================================

Based on OsirisDLL from Divine Divinity version 1.0.0.62 (Osiris version 1.4)

Has to be compiled with a 32-bit MSVC â‰¥ 2019.

DLL wrapper
-----------

Just a bunch of headers and an import library for OsirisDLL.dll.

Compiler wrapper
----------------

A small utility to invoke the compiler in OsirisDLL.dll. Requires the DLL in the same directory.

Common usage is like this (order of arguments matters):

```shell
OsirisCC.exe -log storyeditor\compile.log -compile storyeditor\story.div -save main\startup\story.000
```

... or, if you want the log to be output into the console:

```shell
OsirisCC.exe -log CON -compile storyeditor\story.div -save main\startup\story.000
```

*You might want to use `-init` if you want the databases to be initialized, however that is not recommended - any side-effects in the INIT sections will not be visible in the game for obvious reasons, so see the next section for an alternative solution.*

osi_extender.asi
------------------

Allows you to force the game to run INIT goals when starting a new game. Fixes recompilation of vanilla scripts breaking the game. Requires [ThirteenAG's Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases) to load the mod (name the loader's dll as `winmm.dll`, otherwise it will not work).

Also has a config where you can set up a few things.
